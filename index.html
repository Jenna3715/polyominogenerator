	<h2>Powered by an algorithm developed in CS3733@WPI</h2>

	<p>
	Right now, what we want is an input field that allows the input of a number. The user should then press submit and then all possible polyominos of that number <i>n</i> are rendered on the screen. What should the first step be? We need to create the main functions that encapsulate the algorithms that we need.
